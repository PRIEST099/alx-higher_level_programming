Welcome to the "0x01 Python - If Else, Loops, and Functions" directory in the AlX Higher-Level Programming repository! üêçüåç

## About
This directory contains a collection of Python scripts that cover various topics related to conditional statements, loops, and functions.

## Contents
- **`0-positive_or_negative.py`**: A Python script that generates a random number and prints whether it is positive, zero, or negative.
- **`1-last_digit.py`**: A Python script that generates a random number, extracts its last digit, and determines whether it's greater than 5, less than 6, or 0.
- **`2-print_alphabet.py`**: A Python script that prints the lowercase alphabet.
- **`3-print_alphabt.py`**: A Python script that prints the lowercase alphabet except for the letters 'q' and 'e'.
- **`4-print_hexa.py`**: A Python script that prints hexadecimal numbers from 0 to 98.
- **`5-print_comb2.py`**: A Python script that prints combinations of two-digit numbers.
- **`6-print_comb3.py`**: A Python script that prints combinations of two different digits.
- **`7-islower.py`**: A Python script that defines a function to check if a character is lowercase.
- **`7-main.py`**: A Python script that tests the `islower` function.
- **`8-uppercase.py`**: A Python script that defines a function to convert lowercase characters to uppercase.
- **`8-main.py`**: A Python script that tests the `uppercase` function.
- **`9-print_last_digit.py`**: A Python script that defines a function to print and return the last digit of a number.
- **`9-main.py`**: A Python script that tests the `print_last_digit` function.
- **`10-add.py`**: A Python script that defines a function to add two numbers.
- **`11-pow.py`**: A Python script that defines a function to calculate the power of a number.
- **`12-fizzbuzz.py`**: A Python script that prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz."
- **`12-main.py`**: A Python script that tests the `fizzbuzz` function.
